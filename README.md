# The Types of Augmented Reality used in my projects:
1- Marker-based AR
2- Markerless AR
3- Projection-based AR

1. Marker-based AR
Marker-based AR—also referred to as image recognition AR—relies on a QR code or visual marker, also known as a "fiducial marker", to trigger the interactive experience.

2. Markerless AR
Markerless AR doesn’t rely on physical markers like a QR code or image. Instead, it uses location-based data like GPS or accelerometers in mobile devices to detect and track the user’s environment and determine the location of the virtual content.
This allows the software to understand the spatial relationships and orientation of objects and surfaces in the user’s view and superimpose the virtual content accordingly.
